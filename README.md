# Customer Segmentation

This notebook's purpose is to develop a customer segmentation model to define a marketing strategy. The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables. After the segmentation, I created several classification models for the clusters. I tried to analyze the data in respect of the CRISP-DM methodology. The last phase of the CRISP-DM model is the deployment, which is not within the scope of this project, however, I will mention a few ideas on how to deploy this project in production. The analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/nctung4/Customer_Segmentation/blob/main/Analysis.ipynb).
